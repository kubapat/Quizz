**Announcements** 

**
Yannick and Arthur should comment better on gitLab. Spread work more evenly, maybe Rares should work on the video planning. The video should be with all of us, no code, displaying features, putting focus on the features we're most proud of, preferably the features we worked on ourselves. Maybe practice video/presentation with Timur on Tuesday next week? 

!Deadlines!
- Buddycheck reflection due this friday
- Buddycheck, finalise code, and video presentation the next friday

Make sure you write something meaningful in the buddycheck reflection!

Good work team, let's keep it up this week!
Your cheerful note-taker,
Rares

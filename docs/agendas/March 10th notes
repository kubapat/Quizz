**Notes March 10th**


Use boards

Everyone should have issues assigned in each sprint

Milestone in each sprint

Deadline for the milestones

Sprint backlog, only issues for this week  (not required but recommended)

Switch between back- and front-end

Could switch one person every week, so that there is someone who knows what’s happening and someone who switches.

Update each other every so often (could be every day, every 2 days)

Shorter merge requests (so it’s easier to review)

Issues could be split into 2 or more

Recommended 3 merge requests a week, Required 1 per week

Could use linked issues

Codestyle and checkstyle proper from the start

Rather a little late than not entirely functional

Daily update on discord

More meetings (maybe twice a week)

Demo of what you have done in the week

Review code (daily)

Merge request reviewed by 1 person from both teams

Teams of 3: Front-end and Back-end

Could check contributors tab on Gitlab

Bring up disagreements
